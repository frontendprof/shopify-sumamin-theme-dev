## Usage of Alpine.js for interactivity

Alpine is a rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in your markup. Think of it like jQuery for the modern web. Plop in a script tag and get going.

Alpine is a collection of 15 attributes, 6 properties, and 2 methods.

For its ease of usage, we integrate Alpine.js CDN to the project.
